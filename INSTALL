Building Anoncoin from source

When all the required dependencies have already been built, compiling Anoncoin from source could be as simple as executing the following commands in the Anoncoin root directory

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

This will create the binaries src/anoncoind, src/anoncoin-cli, and src/qt/anoncoin-qt.

To run the test suite, execute

make check

To build the OSX application Anoncoin.app and the Anoncoin.dmg disk image, execute

make deploy
    
Detailed platform-specific build instructions can be found in the files doc/build-*.md

If updating from 0.8.x to 0.9.x, it will be necessary to rebuild the block chain by executing anoncoind or anoncoin-qt with the reindex option

src/qt/anoncoin-qt -reindex
src/anoncoind -reindex
