The Anoncoin project
====================

Anoncoin (ANC) is a peer-to-peer digital cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy and anonymity for its users. Created in June 2013, it is the first and only currency to have built-in support for both the I2P darknet and Tor network that conceal the IP address of the user. Anoncoin will soon be implementing Zerocoin, which will allow users to make payments anonymously, without revealing their anoncoin public addresses.

##Development process##

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready. The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Anoncoin. Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people. The develop branch should be used with extreme caution.
