    //! attacks become a non-issue.  Any serious miner(s), merchant(s) and other interested enthusiasts are also going to be doing the same.  As more
    //! peers run this way, Anoncoin will become more locked to valid UTC time, and resistant to any such effort made by a would be attacker.
    //! In effect this code does adjust peer clock times for those users that need small adjustments made, and have less sophisticated means at their disposal.
    //! We want our node software to start having a much better sense of what UTC time really is, by achieving that we can do a great many other new things.
    //! Such as stop validating new blocks that have come from the future, legacy code allows for up to 2hrs!  Retarget with Headers is then possible for a
    //! much smoother and more evenly spaced block spacing, many other ideas also come to mind.  Millions of devices are now locked to UTC time and run the
    //! world, it has become a part of modern life that Internet technology has brought to us.  Likely many have already taken the time to setup an NTC server
    //! connection for themselves, if that is the case Anoncoin now offers you a personal choice to remove the would be attacker from the equation.  Be warned
    //! though, this code still does not believe you, if that feature has been turned on.  Your systems sense of time, could still be wrong.  In the code
